\chapter{Software Resetting}

When the robot is abnormal and cannot be recovered by adjusting the program or restarting, look for the small round hole marked {\sf RESET} on the back panel of the control box, and use the SIM card removal pin of a mobile phone or a straightened paper clip to press and hold for 20 seconds until the power button indicator on the top of the control box flashes blue. Then you may let go and wait patiently until the button indicator light is steady blue. When the light of the button on the shoulder of the robot lights up, the robot is successfully reset.
