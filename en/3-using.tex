% 场景为操作和使用机器人的基本功能模块，编写一个新场景即可开始操作机器人。

Before describing how to create and edit a scene, let us first get familiar with the scene editor of Lebai Robot and learn how to drag-and-drop teach\footnote{Drag-and-drop teaching: The robot is dragged and driven by human hands. At the same time, the robot can reach a self­balanced running state under the condition of correctly setting the mass and center of mass of the end tool.} operation.

\subsection{Editor Type}

The scene module provides two types of editors:

\newpage

% 乐白机器人的场景支持使用如下两种编辑器进行编程：
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6.5em]
	\item [Timeline Editor]

	A scene editor that is visualized, easy to use, and does not require a user to understand any logical relationships. This editor is suitable for beginners, since a user only need to add corresponding blocks\footnote{In the timeline editor, each operable independent element is called a {\it block}, and a collection of several action blocks can be packaged into a package.} in the timeline editor as needed to operate the robot (See \prettyref{fig:时间轴编辑器}).

		\label{fig:时间轴编辑器}
	\end{figure}

	\newpage

	\item [Code Editor]

	A scene editor that is designed based on Lua language and supports complex operations. A scene editor that is designed based on Lua language and supports complex operations. It is suitable for users with a certain programming foundation and logical thinking. You can write codes to operate the robot (See \prettyref{fig:代码编辑器}).

\section{Drag-and-Drop Teaching}
It is necessary to understand the drag-and-drop teaching method of Lebai robot before learning how to add pose blocks. There are two operation methods for drag-and-drop teaching for you to choose from:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Click the teaching icon \icn{image/36.pdf} in \LM to enable the teaching mode for the robot, drag the robot to the specified position, and click the teaching icon again to exit the teaching mode.
	\item Long press the robot's end convex button\footnote{See \prettyref{sec:硬件按钮}.} to enable the teaching mode for the robot. After dragging the robot to the certain position, release the robot's end convex button to exit the teaching mode.
\end{itemize}

\danger[WARNING]{Before use the drag-and-drop teaching, please make sure to set the mass and CoG of the end device\footnote{See \prettyref{sec:末端设备}.} correctly. Incorrect settings may result in accidental injury.\footnote{See \prettyref{sec:运行安全}.}}

\danger[WARNING]{In the teaching process, the rotation of joint angle should not exceed the safe range\footnote{See \prettyref{sec:运行安全}.}, otherwise it may cause the robot to stop suddenly or result in other faults.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Add A Block}

The Timeline Editor supports the following block types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Position
\item Gripper (Claw)
\item Wait
\item Notification
\item Digital I/O
\item Analog I/O
\item Semaphore
\item Payload
\end{itemize}

Click the Add Block button \icn{image/plus.pdf} in the Timeline Editor to pop up the \nameref{fig:添加动作块弹出框}, as shown in \prettyref{fig:添加动作块弹出框}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{en/image/3-5.png}
	\caption{Choose block type}
	\label{fig:添加动作块弹出框}
\end{figure}

The following chapters describe the usage of different block types in turn.

\subsubsection{Pose Block}
Position\footnote{The ``position'' mentioned in {\ThisBook} consists of robot pose and posture data. In the subsequent content of this document, unless ``pose and posture'' is explicitly mentioned, all ``positions'' refer to the pose and posture of the robot.} is the core control module in robot control. In the Timeline Editor, you only need to add the pose blocks according to the following tutorial to make the robot move according to the predetermined pose and action.
\paragraph{Add position}
There are two ways to add a pose in the Timeline Editor for you to choose from:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add Block button \icn{image/plus.pdf} in the editing area of the Timeline Editor, select the \mnu{Position}, enter the pose name in the open \nameref{fig:添加位置对话框} (as shown in \prettyref{fig:添加位置对话框}), and click the button to save the current pose of the robot in a new pose block\footnote{The ``block'' refers to the smallest visual editing module in the Timeline Editor. A ``module'' represents a type of actions which includes pose and I/O.}.
	\item Double­click the convex button at the end of the robot, and the system will save the current pose of the robot in a new pose block.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{en/image/3-6.png}
	\caption{Dialog of add position}
	\label{fig:添加位置对话框}
\end{figure}

By combining the drag-and-drop teaching and the above method of adding pose blocks, you can add the desired pose blocks according to your needs (as many as you want) until the scene editing is complete.

\paragraph{Edit position}
\label{sec:编辑位置}
As shown in \prettyref{fig:位置块焦点状态}, place the cursor on the pose block to make the current pose block in focus.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{en/image/pose-block.png}
	\caption{The focal state of the pose block}
	\label{fig:位置块焦点状态}
\end{figure}

The two buttons in the trajectory type switching area are used to switch between joint space movement (movej) and Cartesian space linear movement (movel).

\newpage

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\icn{image/ic_joint.pdf}] Represents the movement in joint space\footnote{Joint space: the robot motion space described with the angle of each joint of the robot.}.
	\item[\icn{image/ic_line.pdf}] Represents the linear motion in Cartesian space\footnote{Cartesian space: The full name is Cartesian coordinate system space, which is the rectangular coordinate system space we commonly use.}.
\end{itemize}

The buttons in the edit operation button area are:

\begin{itemize}
\item [\quad] {\sffamily\bfseries Style}: The background color of the block can be changed\footnote{The color of the {Style} button is consistent with the background color of the block. When a block is selected, the block will be highlighted with this color as the background. In particular, the style is transparent by default, and the highlighted back­ ground color selected by the block is blue. The Style, Copy, and Delete buttons are common buttons in the block operation button area.}.
\item [\icn{image/ic_adjust.pdf}] {\sffamily\bfseries Fine-tuning}: Fine­tune and update the location data stored in the current location block.
\newpage
\item [\icn{image/ic_a_v.pdf}] {\sffamily\bfseries Speed and Acceleration Time}: Adjust the speed and acceleration time of the pose block\footnote{The acceleration time is inversely proportional to the acceleration. The greater the acceleration, the shorter the acceleration time; while the shorter the acceleration time, the longer the acceleration time.}.
\item [\icn{image/ic_copy.pdf}] {\sffamily\bfseries Copy}: Copy a current block.
\item [\icn{image/ic_delete.pdf}] {\sffamily\bfseries Delete}: Delete the current block.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fine-tuning}
\label{sec:微调}
When editing a scene, the pose in the motion track needs to be fine­tuned precisely by applying fine-tuning to individual positions. Select the Fine­tuning icon, and the page will automatically jump to the fine­tuning page.

% 微调页面中虚的机器人和实的机器人底座重叠展示，其中虚的机器人表示当前位置块存储的目标位置，实的机器人表示机器人当前位置。
When the current \mnu{ACTUAL POSITION} of the robot is inconsistent with the \mnu{TARGET POSITION} stored in the pose block, a blur robot icon and a solid robot icon will appear in the fine­tuning page. The blur one represents the target pose stored in the current pose block, and the solid one represents the current actual pose of the robot.

You can switch between the actual pose \icn{image/position.pdf} and the target pose \icn{image/saved.pdf} using switch button to view the values of the target pose and the actual position.

\subparagraph{Coordinate space fine-tuning}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{en/image/coor.png}
	\caption{Coordinate space fine-tuning}
	\label{fig:坐标空间微调}
\end{figure}

Different coordinate system representation methods can be selected during fine­tuning:
\begin{itemize}
	\item When ``relative to the Base'', the rectangular coordinate system or cylindrical coordinate system can be used.
	\item When ``relative to the End'', only Cartesian coordinate system is supported.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{en/image/fine_tuning_coordinate.pdf}
	\caption{Coordinate to the base or the end}
	\label{fig:坐标空间示意图}
\end{figure}

When the reference coordinate system is \mnu{To BASE}, it means that the center of the robot base is taken as the origin of the coordinate system.

By selecting the Cartesian coordinate system as the adjustment method, and entering the pose $(X, Y, Z)$ or posture $(R_z, R_y, R_x)$\footnote{The posture of Lebai robot in Cartesian space (Cartesian coordinate system space) adopts EulerZYX notation, please refer to related robot basic books or tutorials. The posture $(R_z, R_y, R_x)$ can also be described as $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.} value in the pose information display box on the fine­tuning page, the robot will automatically move to the pose you choose. You can also operate the robot by pulling the levers in all directions at the bottom of the screen. When the lever is released, the fine adjustment stops. Click the \btn{UPDATE} button to complete the fine adjustment.

Lebai robot uses $Z\textrm{-}Y\textrm{-}X$ Euler angle (EulerZYX) to describe the posture of the end of the robot, that is, first rotate the $R_z$ angle around the $Z$ axis of the coordinate system, then rotate the $R_y$ angle around the $Y$ axis of the rotated coordinate system, and finally rotate around the $X$ axis of the coordinate system by the $R_x$ angle twice.

Select the cylindrical coordinate system\footnote{The X­Y plane of the cylindrical coordinate system is the polar coordinate system. The point $P(x, y, z)$ in the rectangular coordinate system is represented as $P'(\rho, \theta, z)$ in the cylindrical coordinate system, where $\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$，$\theta=\arctan\frac{y}{x}$.} , the left adjustment dial will change from adjustment $(X, Y)$ to adjustment $(\rho, \theta)$.

When the reference coordinate system is selected as \mnu{To END} (without adding TCP\footnote{See \prettyref{sec:TCP设置}.}), the center of the robot flange is used as the origin of the coordinate system, and the rectangular coordinate system is used as the adjustment method. Enter the pose or posture on the fine adjustment page or set the value or pull the lever at the bottom of the screen. After the robot automatically moves to the specified position, click \btn{UPDATE} to complete the fine adjustment of the position.

\subparagraph{Joint space fine-tuning}
Click on the \mnu{Joint Space} at the top left of the fine­tuning page, and enter the angle value of joint 1 to joint 6, then the robot will automatically reach the specified position. Or pull the levers in all directions at the bottom of the screen to operate the robot. When the lever is released, fine­tuning stops. Click \btn{UPDATE} to complete Fine adjustment of position.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{en/image/joints.png}
	\caption{Joint space fine-tuning}
	\label{fig:关节空间微调}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Speed and acceleration time}
Speed and acceleration time are modified for the current scene or the speed ($v$) and acceleration ($a$) of a single location block. The horizontal axis corresponds to the acceleration time. The vertical axis corresponds to the speed. The closer the vertical axis is to the origin, the lower the speed.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=4cm]{en/image/3-11.png}
	\caption{Speed and acceleration time control}
	\label{fig:速度控件}
\end{figure}

To adjust the speed and acceleration time, the user can do it globally\footnote{See \prettyref{sec:速度和加速时间}.} on the toolbar of the scene editor13, or individually for each pose block.

Click the pose block \icn{image/ic_a_v.pdf} button to pop up the \nameref{fig:速度控件}. The icon \icn{image/lock.pdf} in the upper right corner is the synchronization lock between the current pose block and the information about global speed and acceleration time on the editor toolbar. When a new pose is added to the scene, the global lock of the speed and acceleration time control of the pose block is locked by default, which means it is consistent with the global speed and acceleration time of the current scene. When the user drags a drag point to adjust the horizontal or vertical axis of the control and changes the speed and acceleration time, the global lock will be unlocked, that is, the pose block uses the speed and acceleration time specified by yourself and no longer uses the global speed and acceleration time parameter values. You can click the icon \icn{image/unlock.pdf} again to lock Synchronization lock, then the pose block will keep the parameter value consistent with the global speed and acceleration time.

The smooth function mainly refers to that the robot control system automatically optimizes the best path and passes through the target pose of the current pose block without stopping, making the action continuity better and the moving time shorter when there are multiple adjacent pose blocks. higher efficiency. When the smoothing function is turned on, there will be no obvious slowdown and stop when the robot moves between the two blocks.

After adding pose blocks, if you don't need to add other types of blocks, you can move to \prettyref{sec:运行场景}.

\subsubsection{Gripper Block}

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption{Dialog of adding gripper block}
	\label{fig:添加手爪动作对话框}
\end{figure}

Select \mnu{Gripper} in the \nameref{fig:添加动作块弹出框}, and the \nameref{fig:添加手爪动作对话框} will pop up (See \prettyref{fig:添加手爪动作对话框}). Enter a description of the Gripper action and set the strength and amplitude. If you need to preview the opening and closing effect of the Gripper, please turn on the \mnu{Preview} switch (real­time preview) or click the \btn[Info]{PRVIEW} button (manual preview). After confirming the effect is correct, click \btn{ADD}.

\item[Rotate with the same color] The light board displays rotating in a certain color;
\item[Flashing] The light board flashes in a certain color.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Digital I/O Block}
Select \mnu{Digital I/O} in the \nameref{fig:添加动作块弹出框}. In the pop­up Add dialog box, the top tab corresponds to the operation type of the digital I/O. The digital I/O block supports three types of operations:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.5em]
\item[Read] Read the input value of a digital I/O port;
\item[Wait] When the block is executed, it will stay and wait for the value of a certain digital I/O to become the selected value;
\item[Set] Set the output value of a certain digital I/O port.
\end{itemize}

There are three types of digital I/O ports: control box I/O, flange I/O and external I/O (if any).

\subsubsection{Payload Block}
Select \mnu{Payload} in the \nameref{fig:添加动作块弹出框}, and enter the load mass or CoG that needs to be modified in the Add Playload dialog box. This function is used to edit the mass and CoG of the load at runtime.

\danger[WARNING]{When the robot is installed with a end-effector, and the end-effector has functions such as picking and placing items, it is necessary to insert an block corresponding to the change in mass and CoG in the end load after picking and placing in the corresponding pose of the Timeline Editor. If not set normally, there might be reduction in the life of the corresponding parts of the robot, and false alarms in collision detection might result.}

\danger[WARNING]{When adding a Playload configuration, the mass and CoG settings must be as consistent as the end-effector quality. If you need to replace or remove the end-effector, you must edit the load parameters or disable the corresponding end device accordingly, otherwise acci­ dental injury might result.}

\end{itemize}}

\section{Settings}
\subsection{TCP Settings}
\label{sec:TCP设置}
The full name of TCP is Tool Center Point, which means the center point of the robot tool. You can use the TCP setting page to set the offset/conversion amount of the TCP pose and posture of the robot end. The system does not set TCP by default. When the an end effector is installed on the robot, you may choose to add TCP settings according to the scene application.

TCP can be added by teaching. Click the \btn{ADD} button, the \mnu{Teaching Add} in the menu, open the \nameref{fig:示教添加TCP设置} to add TCP settings, as shown in \prettyref{fig:示教添加TCP设置}. Now you can click the Teaching icon and drag-and-drop teach the robot to confirm the four key points one by one in four different postures while the end effector of the robot touches the same control point (that is, keeps the end effector always in contact with the same position). The robot can automatically recognize the TCP pose information according to the different positions and directions of the end flange. The posture information does not support ``add by teaching'' currently, thus need to be filled out manually.

\subsection{Safe Settings}
\subsubsection{Collision detection}
The default state of the robot collision detection is \mnu{Emergency Stop} after the installation guide is opened. While operating, the robot's actions after detecting a collision with external resistance are divided into two types: \mnu{Pause} and \mnu{Emergency Stop}. You can adjust the detection sensitivity by yourself.
